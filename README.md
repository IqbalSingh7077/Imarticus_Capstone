# Imarticus_Capstone

## Overview of the problem
In this project we needed to identify the factors contributing to attrition of the employees and recommend
possible solutions. The files contain complete staff utilization reports for all employees of the XYZ Corp. 
through 2016-2018. The data contains details of employees as well as the details of the projects that they 
have worked on in the last two years. The other file contains all the attrition in the organization for the
years 2015-18 with details such as reason of attrition along with other employee details

The data was divided into train and test data set. we used the training data to build models/analytical solution
and finally apply it to test data to measure the performance and robustness of the models.

## Objective: To build a Machine Learning model to predict the following:
1. Identify factors influencing attrition
2. Predict possible attritions
3. Identify possible ways to retain high performers

## Data sources
Data used For Data analysis & Model Makeing in this capstone project was provided by **Imarticus Learnings**.

# Modeling
The problem at hand was of classification, hence we chose famous classification algorithmâ€™s, Logistic Regression,
Decision tree  & Random Forest to make ML model.

# Evaluation
All the models performed well with over 90% accuracy, but Random Forest weas better among all with 96% accuracy.
